AWS CloudWatch Logs Exporter sends logs data to AWS [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html).
AWS credentials are retrieved from the [default credential chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials).
Region must be configured in the configuration if not set in the default credential chain.

NOTE: OpenTelemetry Logging support is experimental, hence this exporter is subject to change.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `log_group_name`: The group name of the CloudWatch logs.
- `log_stream_name`: The stream name of the CloudWatch logs.

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `region`: The AWS region where the log stream is in.
- `endpoint`: The CloudWatch Logs service endpoint which the requests are forwarded to. [See the CloudWatch Logs endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cwl_region.html) for a list.
- `log_retention`: LogRetention is the option to set the log retention policy for only newly created CloudWatch Log Groups. Defaults to Never Expire if not specified or set to 0.  Possible values for retention in days are 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1827, 2192, 2557, 2922, 3288, or 3653. 
- `role_arn`: The AWS IAM role to upload segments to a same/different account
- `raw_log`: Boolean default false. If you want to export only the log message to cw logs. This is required for emf logs.
